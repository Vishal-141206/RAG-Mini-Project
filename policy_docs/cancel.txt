Cancellation Policy

This Cancellation Policy outlines the terms under which customers may cancel orders placed on our platform.

Order Cancellation Window
Customers may cancel an order within 24 hours of placing it without any penalty, provided the order has not yet been shipped.

Orders After Shipment
Once an order has been shipped, cancellation is no longer possible. In such cases, customers must wait for delivery and then initiate a return request in accordance with the Refund Policy.

How to Request Cancellation
Cancellation requests must be submitted through the customer account dashboard or by contacting customer support. Requests submitted through unofficial channels will not be accepted.

Refunds After Cancellation
If a cancellation request is approved:
- Any prepaid amount will be refunded using the original payment method.
- Refund processing timelines will follow the standard refund process.
- No additional cancellation fee is charged for cancellations made within the allowed window.

Exceptions
The company may refuse cancellation requests in cases such as:
- Orders involving customized or made-to-order products
- Bulk or corporate orders
- Suspected misuse or fraudulent activity

The company reserves the right to cancel orders unilaterally in case of pricing errors, stock unavailability, or policy violations.
