Refund Policy

Our company aims to ensure customer satisfaction with every purchase. This Refund Policy explains the conditions, process, and timelines for requesting and receiving a refund.

Eligibility for Refund
Customers are eligible for a refund within 7 calendar days from the date of delivery of the product. Requests made after this period will not be considered unless required by applicable consumer protection laws.

Conditions for Refund
To qualify for a refund, all of the following conditions must be met:
- The product must be unused, undamaged, and in its original condition.
- The product must be returned in its original packaging along with all accessories, manuals, and free items received.
- Proof of purchase, such as an invoice or order confirmation, must be provided.
- The refund request must be initiated through the official customer support channel.

Inspection and Approval
Once the returned product is received, it undergoes a quality inspection. Refunds are initiated only after the inspection is completed and the return is approved. If the product fails inspection, the refund request may be rejected.

Refund Method and Timeline
Approved refunds are processed using the original method of payment. Refund processing typically takes 5 to 7 business days after approval, depending on the customer’s bank or payment provider.

Non-Refundable Items
Certain items may not be eligible for refunds, including but not limited to:
- Products marked as non-returnable at the time of purchase
- Digital goods or downloadable content
- Gift cards or promotional vouchers

The company reserves the right to modify this policy at any time without prior notice.
